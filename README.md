# ios_human_interface

A Flutter project to showcase ios widgets developed by Flutter.

## Introduction
I used and customize system-defined components of iOS build by Flutter to give people a familiar and consistent experience.

  <img src="assets/intro_page.gif" alt="intro page screenshot" width="200" />

## Image View
An image view displays a single image.
Within an image view, you can stretch, scale, size to fit, or pin the image to a specific location.
<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/image_view_page.gif" alt="intro page screenshot" width="200" />
  <img src="assets/image_view_legibility.gif" alt="intro page screenshot" width="200" />

<b>Take care when overlaying text on images.</b> Compositing text on top of images can decrease both the clarity of the image and the legibility of the text. To help improve the results, I've added a opaque background layer.
